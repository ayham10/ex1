            <p><b><i>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.<br>
                 About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is<br> covered with water,
                  mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute <br>the hydrosphere.
                   Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several<br>
                 rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years.<br>
                  Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that<br>
                   generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</i></b>
